# About R Programming

--> R is an open-source programming language that is widely used as a statistical software and data analysis tool.<br><br>
--> R generally comes with the Command-line interface.<br><br>
--> R is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br><br>
--> R also provides rich Library support.<br>

<h1>Modes of Executions</h1>
Rprogramming language can be executed in the following two modes:
<h2>1. Interactive mode</h2>
<h3>a) R Studio</h3>
R can also be run on the R Studio IDLE. It is an acronym of "Integrated DeveLopment Environment".<br>
<h3>b) Google Colab</h3>
Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research which allows anybody to write and execute r code in Jupyter notebook through the browser.<br>
<h2>2. Script mode</h2>
R programs are written in editors and saved as the file with the .r extension which can be executed further. <br>

# Basic Datatypes
 <img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/r-data-types.png" height=400 width=680 title="Datatypes-of-R-programming" alt="Datatypes-of-R-programming">

R data types are the essential features that accept and store various data types.

Some of the most common data types in R are:
<ol>
<li>Numeric: Decimal numbers like 10.5, 55, 787.</li>
<li>Integer: Whole numbers like 1L, 55L, and 100L (the letter “L” declares this as an integer).</li>
<li>Character: Strings of text like “hello”, “R”, and “data”.</li>
<li>Logical: Boolean values like TRUE or FALSE.</li>
<li>Factor: Categorical variables like “red”, “green”, and “blue”.</li>
<li>Vector: A collection of elements of the same data type like c(1,2,3) or c(“a”,“b”,“c”).</li>
<li>Matrix: A two-dimensional array of elements of the same data type like matrix(1:9,nrow=3).</li>
<li>Data frame: A table-like structure with rows and columns that can have different data types like data.frame(name=c(“Alice”,“Bob”),age=c(25,30)).</li>
<li>List: It is a collection of elements that can have different data types like list(name=“Alice”,age=25,scores=c(90,80,70)).</li>
 <li>Array: It is a list or vector with two or more dimensions. An array is like a stacked matrix; a matrix is a two-dimensional array.</li>
</ol>

 # Dataset Used

 <h2>Iris Dataset</h2>
--> Iris has 4 numerical features and a tri class target variable.<br><br>
--> This dataset can be used for classification as well as clustering.<br><br>
--> In this dataset, there are 4 features sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width and the target variable has 3 classes namely ‘setosa’, ‘versicolor’, and ‘virginica’.<br><br>
--> Dataset is already cleaned,no preprocessing required.<br><br>
--> This dataset is simply used for understanding CSV features and data Visualization.<br>

<h2>Automobile Dataset</h2>
--> Dataset is taken from: <a href="https://gist.github.com/lauvshree/20ee07bfaa6d97364006fc2320092526">🔗<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/github/github-original-wordmark.svg" height =40 width=40 title="Automobile Dataset" alt="Automobile Dataset"> </a><br><br>
--> This contains data about various automobile in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.<br><br>
--> CSV file contains the details of automobile-mileage,length,body-style among other attributes.<br><br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[60 rows X 6 columns].<br><br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>

<h2>NBA Players Dataset</h2>
--> Dataset is taken from: <a href="https://gist.github.com/ganeshbabuNN/80b55569fde8eb6a81518d4c8921c7a6" >🔗<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/github/github-original-wordmark.svg" height =40 width=40 title="NBA Dataset" alt="NBA Dataset"> </a><br><br>
--> This contains data about various NBA Players in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.<br><br>
--> CSV file contains the details of players-height,weight,team,position among other attributes.<br><br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[457 rows X 9 columns].<br><br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>
